        <p class="description">
          We met in a dark alley one evening, each having acquired special
          skills from their respective lurid backgrounds.<br /><br />After a
          fearsome battle in which each pulled their weight (which stands at a
          combined eighty-eight pounds) and much blood was shed, the team found
          out that they were in fact all blood-related.<br /><br />
          Realising their strength in numbers, the team formed a contract that
          prevents any member from being more than five metres away from any
          other member for more than thirty seconds.<br /><br />This contract
          also forbids each member from getting married; having children;
          meeting new people or seeing their friends or families.<br /><br />A
          daunting contract indeed when you consider the combined age of the
          members is five hundred and sixty years.

              In the deepest, darkest jungles of Peru, Christine met her mentor
              and lifelong fashion icon, Paddington Bear. With fists of fury and
              a level temperament, Christine can be messed with but shan't allow
              it to bother her!

              disappointed that she was not born a phoenix. Rising on a path of
              fire of her own, at a young age she mastered the disciplines of
              vegetable spiralising and robot building.

              Reuben, 6, has been coding for two decades. He is often surprised
              when his code runs, as it is only valid by coincidence and is
              actually all a failed attempt to write in French. Reuben actually
              hates the nickname "Reuben," and would prefer to be called by his
              birth name, "Reuuuuuubennnnnn."

              Gregor was born in London in 1989. He took ten years of full-time
              speech therapy to acquire his distinctive Scottish accent, after
              which he found out that this kind of education was not enough to
              get a job. This is when he turned to coding.
